# Foundry VTT â€“ Layers-Panel
A Foundry VTT Module that adds a layers-panel tool to the inbuilt drawing-tools.

## Installation
Initial proof-of-concept release; please report any bugs, issues, or suggestions in the [issues tracker](https://github.com/bluesatin/foundry-vtt-layers-panel/issues).

You can currently manually install the module in Foundry VTT by using the module.json URL:  
`https://github.com/bluesatin/foundry-vtt-layers-panel/releases/latest/download/module.json`

Once installed and activated in your world, you can access the panel by going into the drawing-tools in the top left and there should now be an extra button at the bottom of the drawing-tools as shown in the preview screenshot below.

## Project Details

Designed for assisting people in creating basic battle-maps in Foundry VTT using the inbuilt drawings layer and tools. 

Currently the default Foundry VTT workflow makes the selection and modification of objects very awkward when they're layered on top of each other, which is the initial workflow problem I wanted to fix for myself, hence the start of the project. I'd like to implement some further workflow improvements for building maps within Foundry VTT, if you have any ideas on simple workflow improvements, feel free to check the [issues tracker](https://github.com/bluesatin/foundry-vtt-layers-panel/issues) and add your suggestion if it's not already present.
