## Details
Initial proof-of-concept release, likely to be rough around the edges.

Please report any bugs, issues, or suggestions in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bluesatin/foundry-vtt-layers-panel/issues).

Designed for assisting people in creating basic battle-maps in Foundry VTT using the drawing-tools canvas layer. Currently the default workflow makes the selection and modification of objects very awkward when they're layered on top of each other.

I'd like to implement a bunch of extra workflow improvements for building battle-maps in the future, but improving the ability to actually select objects seemed like the most annoying problem to fix first.
